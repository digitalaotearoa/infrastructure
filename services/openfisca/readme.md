# OpenFisca Service

The Openfisca repository at https://github.com/govzeroaotearoa/openfisca-aotearoa has a webhook configured. 
This webhook hits the webhook service running on g0v.nz infrastructure and triggers a rebuild of the production
service and a redeployment of it at every push to the repository.
