# Hedgedoc 

![](https://docs.hedgedoc.org/images/hedgedoc_logo_white.svg)

Hedgedoc is an open source version of hackmd.io. The project used to be called HackPadCE, then CodiMD and 
has recently renamed again to [HedgeDoc](https://hedgedoc.org/).

Using `docker-compose.yml` it can be configured to allow [social logins](https://docs.hedgedoc.org/configuration/#login-methods), 
custom [storage backends](https://docs.hedgedoc.org/configuration/#upload-storage) for file uploads and 
[other parameters](https://docs.hedgedoc.org/configuration/)

For g0v Aotearoa's installation we will:

- [ ] Setup Twitter Login
- [ ] Setup GitHub Login
- [ ] Setup Google Login
- [ ] Setup File Upload (possibly with our own [minio](https://min.io/) service)
- [ ] Configure backups
